The first person to give the correct answer wins that challenge, and takes away the prize money.\nThe game consists of a web based UI, and a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain where you would normally find the backend. This smart contract ensures that *not even us* can cheat the game.\nWe won\u2019t bore you with powerpoint bullet lists from hell, nor will we simply use handwaving to explain the concepts. We will go on stage and *actually program* the game during this session. We\u2019ll show you that especially in immature development environments you can rely on good coding practices such as Test Driven Development and Pair Programming.\nWe intend for you to walk away from this session not only knowing how to start developing a Blockchain app, but also wanting to!\n",

In just a few days, your app is going to be available globally.

It is a team effort and everyone, from Developers to UX Designers or Product Managers, need to be involved, and therefore, to know its basics. In this talk we will try to provide a few techniques for improving those two areas of your apps from the points of view of the code, the use of tools we have available and the users\u2019 expected experience.\nA series of examples will be presented, showing how some of your users may perceive your app when localisation and accessibility are not correctly implemented or not implemented at all. \nYou would freak out if the \u2018Back\u2019 button was on the right side of the navigation bar, but that is what users that speak right-to-left written languages expect. If a modal view was presented without a \u2018Close\/Done\u2019 button, you would consider it a bug, but it may exactly be what you are giving to blind users.\nSmartphones, apps and the whole Apple ecosystem has helped us develop much more inclusive apps that anyone can use.

Topics covered include: showing surface updates to help you find layout loops in your app, showing layout bounds to get your views pixel perfect, and aggressively killing processes and activities to ensure that your app performs well under stress.

Enter serverless cloud platforms\u2026 \nServerless platforms allow developers to push code, rather than VMs, into the cloud. The platforms allow you to connect external event sources like API requests or message queues to functions in your code. As events occur, your code is instantiated and executed to process each request. Developers are only billed for the milliseconds needed to process each request.\nIn this workshop, developers will learn how to build backends and APIs using Swift on \u201cserverless\u201d cloud platforms. We&#8217;ll work through getting started with Apache OpenWhisk, an open-source serverless cloud platform that supports Swift natively. Developers will learn how to create simple serverless swift functions, before building up to more complicated applications and architectures. People leaving the session will have all the skills to be able to build scalable microservices on serverless cloud platforms using Swift.\n",

We welcome independent developers, \nfreelancers and developers working for a company \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter \nwho you are or where you work, if you work with mobile technology \nyou\u2019ll enjoy this conference. <br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Conference Code of Conduct<\/b><br\/>\nWe have adopted a code of conduct that helps us make the conference a welcome and safe place for everyone. \nYou can find the <a href=\"http:\/\/mdevcon.com\/conference-code-of-conduct\/\">code of conduct here<\/a>.\n<br\/>\n<b>Location<\/b><br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Tutorial day:<\/b> NH Carlton (near Rembrandt Plein) <br\/>\nVijzelstraat 4<br\/>\nAmsterdam <br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Conference day:<\/b> Tuschinski Theater (near Rembrandt Plein) <br\/>\nReguliersbreestraat 26 <br\/>\nAmsterdam <br\/>\n<br\/>\nThere\u2019s one place where a mobile developer conference makes perfect sense: <b>Appsterdam.<\/b> \nFounded by Mike Lee, appsterdam is a growing European community of app developers located \nin or near Amsterdam. Visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/appsterdam.rs\/\">Appsterdam website<\/a> for more information about this vibrant \ncommunity of developers or to become a member. The conference is open to a world wide \naudience and we hope it will be an opportunity for many developers to get a sense of \nthe great atmosphere in Appsterdam! <br\/>\n<br\/>\nAs for the venue, we looked hard to find a location that is easy to reach but also inspiring. \nThe conference will be held in the Tuschinski Theater. According to wikipedia it is \n\u2018considered one of the most beautiful cinemas in the world\u2019. This means that we\u2019ll not \nonly have presentations literally on the big screen, it means we\u2019ll have comfy chairs \nto enjoy the conference. We were also very interested in this venue because of its \nexcellent \u2018hallway track\u2019. This unofficial track in between or during sessions where you \nmeet other developers and speakers is just as valuable as the main content tracks, \nand Tuschinski is a great place to talk to people or to just hang out.\n"
